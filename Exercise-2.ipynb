    "\n",
    "You should discretize this equation onto $N_x$ space points, with separation $\\Delta x = h$, and into timesteps $\\Delta t = \\tau$.  In the equations below, I use subscript $i$ as a space index, and superscript $n$ for time indices.\n",

    "Having discretized the problem, you should use the _implicit_ finite difference equation, as discussed in lectures :\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{u_i^{n+1} - u_i^n}{\\tau} = k \\frac{u_{i+1}^{n+1} - 2u_i^{n+1} + u_{i-1}^{n+1}}{h^2}$$\n",

    "In the problems below, you are asked to solve the diffusion equation in the context of the heat equation. Here, $k$ is the thermal diffusivity, given by $k = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\rho C}$, where $\\lambda$ is the thermal conductivity, $\\rho$ is the density, and $C$ is the specific heat capacity. The questions below concern an iron poker of length 50cm.  You may take the thermal conductivity of iron to be a constant 59 W/m/K, its specific heat as 450 J/kg/K, and its density as 7,900 kg/m3.  You can ignore heat loss along the length of the poker.\n"
